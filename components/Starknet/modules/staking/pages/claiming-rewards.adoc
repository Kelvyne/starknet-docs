:description: How to claim your staking rewards on Starknet by directly interacting with the staking contract.

Staking rewards on Starknet accumulate over time as your staked STRK tokens participate in securing the network. To claim these rewards, you must interact with the staking contract and execute the necessary functions.

.Prerequisites

* A Starknet-compatible block explorer or CLI tool.
* The address of the staking contract. _**(TODO: Check if this really needs to be mentioned.)**_
* The staker address must be registered in the staking contract with an active stake.
* The caller must be either the staker or the stakerâ€™s reward address.

.Procedure

. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the staking contract.
. In the contract interface, locate and select the `claim_rewards` function.
. Enter the following parameters:

* In *`staker_address`*, enter the staker's address for which you are claiming the rewards.
. Submit the transaction to initiate the rewards claim.

Once the transaction is successful, the rewards will be transferred to the designated reward address associated with your staked tokens.

For stakers participating in delegation pools, use the `claim_delegation_pool_rewards` function in the delegation pooling contract to claim rewards accumulated through the pool:

. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the delegation pooling contract.
. Locate and select the `claim_delegation_pool_rewards` function.
. Enter the following parameters:

* In *`staker_address`*, enter the staker's address associated with the pool.
. Submit the transaction to claim the pooled rewards.

After successfully claiming rewards, they will be transferred to the respective reward address associated with either your individual stake or pooled stake.
