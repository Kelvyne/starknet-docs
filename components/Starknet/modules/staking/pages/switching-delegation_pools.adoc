= Switching Delegation Pools

:description: How to switch your delegation from one staking pool to another on Starknet by directly interacting with the staking contract.

Switching delegation pools allows you to move your staked tokens from one delegation pool to another. This operation requires interacting with both the staking contract and the delegation pooling contracts.

.Prerequisites

* A Starknet-compatible block explorer or CLI tool.
* The addresses of the current and target delegation pooling contracts.
* Your staker address and the amount of tokens you wish to switch.

.Procedure

. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the current delegation pooling contract.
. In the contract interface, locate and select the `exit_delegation_pool_intent` function.
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`staker_address`*, enter your staker address.
* In *`identifier`*, enter a unique identifier for the exit intent.
* In *`amount`*, enter the amount of tokens you wish to move.
. Submit the transaction to initiate the exit from the current delegation pool.

. Once the exit intent has been registered, navigate to the staking contract.
. Locate and select the `switch_staking_delegation_pool` function.
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`to_staker`*, enter the staker address associated with the new delegation pool.
* In *`to_pool`*, enter the contract address of the new delegation pool.
* In *`amount`*, enter the amount of tokens to transfer.
* In *`data`*, enter any additional data required by the contract.
. Submit the transaction to switch the delegation pool.

. Finally, navigate to the new delegation pooling contract.
. Locate and select the `enter_from_staking_contract` function.
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`amount`*, enter the amount of tokens being moved.
* In *`index`*, enter the index provided by the staking contract.
* In *`data`*, enter the necessary data from the previous step.
. Submit the transaction to complete the switch to the new delegation pool.

After these steps, your staked tokens will be transferred from the original delegation pool to the new one, and your staking rewards will start accruing in the new pool.
