:description: How to manage delegation pools within the Starknet staking protocol, including adding and removing funds from delegation pools.

Managing delegation pools in the Starknet staking protocol allows stakers to efficiently handle the distribution and withdrawal of pooled funds. This section covers the necessary steps for both adding to and removing from delegation pools.

.Prerequisites

* A Starknet-compatible block explorer or CLI tool.
* Your staker address and the delegation pool contract address.
* The amount of tokens you wish to add to or remove from the delegation pool.

== Adding to a Delegation Pool

.Procedure

. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the staking contract.
. Locate and select the `add_to_delegation_pool` function.
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`pooled_staker`*, enter the staker address associated with the delegation pool.
* In *`amount`*, enter the amount of tokens you wish to add to the pool.
. Submit the transaction to add the specified amount to the delegation pool.

Upon completion, the tokens will be transferred from the delegation pool contract to the staking contract, and the pooled amount for the staker will be updated.

== Removing from a Delegation Pool

.Procedure

. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the staking contract.
. Locate and select the `remove_from_delegation_pool_intent` function.
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`staker_address`*, enter your staker address.
* In *`identifier`*, enter a unique identifier for this removal request.
* In *`amount`*, enter the amount of tokens you wish to remove from the pool.
. Submit the transaction to signal your intent to remove funds from the delegation pool.

. After the waiting period has elapsed, return to the staking contract using your block explorer.
. Locate and select the `remove_from_delegation_pool_action` function.
. Enter the following parameters:
+
* In *`identifier`*, enter the identifier used in the intent step.
. Submit the transaction to finalize the removal of funds from the delegation pool.

Upon completion, the specified amount will be transferred back to the delegation pool contract, and the pooled amount for the staker will be updated.
