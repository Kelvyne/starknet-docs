:description: How to exit the Starknet staking protocol by interacting directly with the staking contract, including initiating and finalizing the unstaking process.

.Procedure

. Using a Starknet block explorer, navigate to the staking contract.
. Locate and select the `unstake_intent` function.
. Submit the transaction to signal your intent to exit the staking protocol. This action will set a mandatory waiting period before you can finalize the unstaking.

. Locate and select the `unstake_action` function.
. Enter the following parameters:

* In *`staker_address`*, enter your staker address.
. Submit the transaction to finalize the unstaking process and retrieve your staked tokens.

Upon completion of these steps, your staked tokens will be transferred back to your wallet, and you will have exited the staking protocol.
